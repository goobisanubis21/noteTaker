# noteTaker
The note taker app allows a user to create a note with a title and details, user is then able to save and view the notes. If a note is no longer relavent to the user, they are able to delete the note which will cause the app to update and it will no longer be seen. This app uses express for the back end to store and get all notes which are saved in a json formatted database file. It also is using uuid to give each note its oqn personal id in order to compare the notes in the database to a selected note marked for deletion.
